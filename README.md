Use terminal to open the file and follow the template:

**python driver_3.py bfs/dfs/ast [type the initial configuration here and delete the brackets]**

Example input: python driver_3.py ast 6,1,8,4,0,2,7,3,5

The result will be printed in terminal with a field named "path_to_goal," and you can find the same result in a output.txt file in your directory.

If the program never stops, it is because the n puzzle game is unsolvable. About half of the n puzzle games are unsolvable.

Follow the path and you will solve the n puzzle problem easily!
